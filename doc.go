/*
package sla defines the service-level agreement for cirello.io/... packages.

	Service-Level Agreement
	=======================

	*originally by https://github.com/shurcooL/SLA/blob/master/README.md*

	This service-level agreement (SLA) describes the level of support that you should expect.

	Uptime
	------

	-	**[95%+ uptime](https://uptime.is/95)**

		If the packages have tests enabled, then the packages will build successfully, and have their tests pass at least 95% of the time in a year.

		Check a summary of building state at the [dashboard](BUILD-DASHBOARD.md).

	Response Time
	-------------

	-	**â‰¤ 7 days response time**

		Issues, pull requests and comments are responded to within 7 days.

	API Stability Changes
	---------------------

	-	**No backwards compatibility**

		I do not guarantee backwards compatibility. I do check from time to time if there are importers using my packages and I shall try to reach them through issue/bug trackers about the breaking changes.

	-	**Vanity URL stability**

		Once I publish a package in a URL, it shall remain in the same URL until I see no one is importing it anymore. I reserve the right to fork the package into another URL in case of conceptual changes.

	Go Version
	----------

	-	**Current stable Go version only**

		Quoting @shurcooL _ipsis literis_:
		> Current stable Go version is supported. Previous versions may work, but aren't guaranteed to. I don't go out of my way to break support for previous versions, but I don't hold back on using new features from current stable Go version.

	Applicability
	-------------

	This SLA applies to all Go packages under the following namespaces:

	-	[`cirello.io/...`](https://cirello.io/...)
